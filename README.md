android application plays an array of tunes up to the user's discretion

This application contains a progress bar mimicking that of an mp3 player. There are seven mp3 files in which the user can choose to play. Once a different tune is chosen the sound resets. The stop button resets any tune and the play and pause button switches back and forth depending on if the song is playing or not. 
The application incorporates screen rotation, a progress bar, and the music stops if the application closes.
